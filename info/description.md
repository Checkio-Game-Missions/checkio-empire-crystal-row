Because crystals are such an important resource, systems must be put in place to check the crystal quality during
the growth and harvest periods. For our initial tests, we use random spot checks on the atomic lines composing each
of the crystals. This crystal type contains two atoms composing the elements "X" (Xenatom) and "Z" (Zorium). In a
well grown crystal, these atoms should alternate down the atomic line.

You are given a random line from crystal lattice as a sequence of letters "X" and "Z". The good line should have the
periodic arrangement (one by one) as ["X", "Z", "X", "Z"]. If any atoms are repeated, then this crystal is broken.
